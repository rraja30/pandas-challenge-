# Pandas challenge
Creating and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

As a first task, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. After being given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
